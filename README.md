# Momentum, now with momentum!
Momentum (he/she) is a bot for the amazing Discord community Study Fam.
She is not a tool, but an assistant, and friend, for our fellow members who study with us.

Stepmom, or Momentum, is a complete rewrite of Momentum which was originally written in Python with Discord.py in 2020.
It is rewritten in Rust with Serenity/Poise as a Discord library, and with SQLite + SQLX instead of MongoDB + pymongo.
This project is not only a rewrite, but also a reimagination of what Momentum is. With four years of experience with her, we now know what works, what doesn't, what we need, what we don't. Momentum was admittedly full of mistakes.
It's a big change! I hope this project will help everyone in our community, both by aiding in studying, and being there as a friend.
Made with ðŸ¦¦ in the pond.
